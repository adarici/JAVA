	/*
	 1) What is encapsulation?
	 	reduce complexity, increase re-usability
	 	Encapsulation is a process used to protect and hide data.
	 	preventing other classes from accessing directly to the instance variables
	 	Data hiding process is called "Encapsulation"
	 	accessing results while hiding data.
	 	Getters method is used to read the encapsulated data while 
	 	setters method is used to update the data.
	 	
	 2) How do you hide your data?
	 	By using "private" access modifiers
	 	
	 3) How do you access hidden data from other classes?
	 	By creating Getter and Setter
	 	to read ==> getter
	 	to update==> setter
	 	
	 4) what is immutable class?
	 	the class we can not update.
	 	we use just getter method
	 	no need to create setter
	 	our variables should be private but not the class.
	 	
	 5) What should be the date type foe getter and setter?
	 	for setter ==> void.
	 	for getter==> int, String,double...
	 	
	 6) What are the features of Encapsulation?
	 	re-usability
	 	flexibility
	 	maintenance
	 	reduction of complexity
	 	combine the data of our application and its manipulation at one place
